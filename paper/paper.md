### Abstract
This paper explores big data as a smart technological aggregate of database technologies utilized at the software and hardware levels. The paper reviews the origin of big data and its current status in the business, technology, and governmental circles. In the academic theory, the writer reviews the requirements of big data technology, the architecture, and the implementation of the same. The paper also studies the benchmarks that have been developed in order to standardize big data. It is revealed that the technology is relatively young to employ most of these benchmarks. In respect to privacy, big data poses a major threat to peoples entitlement to confidential data by design. As such, it is necessary that big data is regulated.
