### Abstract
This paper explores big data as a smart technological aggregate of database technologies utilized at the software and hardware levels. The paper reviews the origin of big data and its current status in the business, technology, and governmental circles. In the academic theory, the writer reviews the requirements of big data technology, the architecture, and the implementation of the same. The paper also studies the benchmarks that have been developed in order to standardize big data. It is revealed that the technology is relatively young to employ most of these benchmarks. In respect to privacy, big data poses a major threat to peoples entitlement to confidential data by design. As such, it is necessary that big data is regulated. 

### Introduction
Big data refers to the study and the application of complex data sets in application software and hardware. Big data is associated with certain qualities of data such as variety, velocity, volume, veracity, and value. The computer and information age has made big data even more practical and relevant in processing information. Today, big data entails the use of computerized systems which execute predictive analytics and user behavior analytics. These analytics extract value from data sets. Most processed data is available in large volumes. However, that is not a huge problem when working with big data. To computer systems, processing a single record will take the fraction of a second. Processing a million records will not take a million seconds. Instead, it might take a few extra seconds. Modern computer systems utilize economies of scale in a manner that cannot be replicated in any other domain. 

The most important characteristic of big data is that it analyses large data sets in a manner that is intuitive. This explains why big data has become so popular in nearly every field in the society: government, internet search, fin-tech, business informatics, urban informatics, medicine, and travel. Big data poses a threat to privacy since the end user does not have the centralized infrastructure required to make it work flawlessly. There is always a billion-dollar company out there with access to individualsâ€™ private information for every smart device out there.  

## Academic Theory

### Requirements
One of the main reasons why big data is growing rapidly is the increase in the popularity of devices which fall under the internet-of-things. Therefore, gathering the data necessary for processing is relatively easy (Provost & Fawcett, 2013). Over the past 4 decades, the technological ability to store data per capita has nearly doubled. This will only continue to grow over the next several decades. 

The greatest concern for millennials and Gen-Z is who should stay in control of the big data initiatives. This raises the question of privacy. Trusting big companies such as Facebook, Apple, Google, Amazon, and Microsoft is not considered to be a credible solution. These companies own most of the big data infrastructure in the world. Moreover, they have a monopoly over all the internet-of-things devices such that they can essentially shut down all the competition by making their services and devices cheaper while harvesting user information. 

The leaders of these companies are not elected by the public and are out to maximize profits. This is dangerous given that they already have a monopoly over modern communication but manage to operate as private entities capable of ideological, cultural, and religious bias. Moreover, they are not answerable to anyone other than their investors who usually only care about the bottom line. Big data promises the world numerous benefits over the next several decades. However, this comes at the cost of giving up liberties enshrined in the constitutions of most countries that have a Bill of Rights.
