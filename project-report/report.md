## Abstract

The advancement of technology has affected education in a big way. In recent times, the educators and administrators mainly rely on the Student Information Systems (SISs), Learning Management Systems (LMSs), and Admissions Management Systems to streamline classroom, school and campus operations (Girard, Klein & Berg, 2015). Therefore, as institutions continue to adopt such systems, user data is generated, which helps the education stakeholders including the parents to make more informed decisions on how the learning process can be improved. As a result, Vanthienen & Witte (2018), highlights that big data has fundamentally changed the way education is offered, and institutions that invest in the big data and successfully derive value from their data will have a distinct advantage over others. Moreover, Williamson (2017) anticipates that in the near future there will be a performance gap between the institutions with big data systems and those that have not implemented such systems. This is because as time goes by, more relevant data will be generated, and the emerging technologies and digital channels will offer better acquisition and delivery mechanisms. For instance, teachers can mine learning patterns to see how students master specific subjects and experimental designs. Therefore, this paper analyzes how big data is relevant in the education system. 

## Introduction

Today, many organizations are collecting, storing, and analyzing massive amounts of data. This data is commonly referred to as “big data” because of its volume, the velocity with which it arrives and the variety of forms it takes. Therefore, big data can be described as the process which is used to convert continuous, analog information into discrete, digital and machine reliable format. Examples of big data include web data, text data, time and location data, smart grid, and social network data. Such data can be utilized in educational institutions by using the data-driven approaches that make it possible to study learning in real-time and offer systematic feedback to students and teachers (Vanthienen & Witte, 2018). As a result, it is crucial to explore how the big data is used to mine learning information for insights regarding student performance and learning approaches.  

## Forms of Big Data in Education institution

### A.	Administrative Data
These type of data refers to the demographic, behavioral, and achievement data collected through schools, government agencies, and their contractors. It is obtained by sampling many participants, which can be longitudinally at prescribed, or regular intervals. In most cases, this type of data is made up by attendance records, test scores, transcripts, and surveys. Examples of the administrative data that can be taken as big data include international test scores, a national assessment of educational progress data, and the behavior data that is collected by the U.S. Department of Education’s Civil Rights Data Collection.

### B.	Learning Process Data

They are continuous or near-continuous, fine-grained records, mostly in the form of digital interactions of students behaviors to illuminate learning processes. The learning process data is considered big data since it involves many participants and a large number of variables in regards to a single person. Examples of learning process include online assessments and courses such as the massive open online courses.
